This map helps me to see how widespread my project is so far, so that I can adapt AWTRIX to certain countries, and of course it motivates me massively to offer you more and more features.
The coordinates are generated from IP addresses by HTTP requests to the AWTRIX Cloud Server (such as icon or app downloads).  
No further settings or information is sent. This information is not passed on to third parties and is not stored. The information is temporarily held in memory while my server is running and is completely deleted as soon as an AWTRIX host is offline for more than 10 minutes. No files are created!

!> Every normal web page request, e-mail delivery or other HTTP requests always leaves the IP address on the respective server. But you can decide via the "Analytics"-button in the host settings if I can use it for evaluation and thus for this map.
