## **3D-Print**

The housing can be created with a 3D printer. The necessary files can be downloaded from [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2791276).

The 3D objects are already aligned as they should be printed to require as little support material as possible. Please print the **LED grid in black**, otherwise the "pixels" are not clearly separated, as they shine through the material.
**Recommended print settings:**

* 0.2 mm layer resolution

* 20% infill

* Support from the bed

* 45-55 mm/s

## **Assembly**

First of all, glue the 2 parts for the LED Grid together on the inside.
As a diffuser I used high quality and thicker paper - itâs important that you donât see the fibres when you hold it against bright light like normal printer paper.
Then smear the flat side of the LED grid with glue stick and glue the paper onto it.
this is best done where Awtrix will end up. Due to high temperature and humidity fluctuations, the paper can warp slightly.
Then put the 2 housings parts together and, if necessary, fix it with a little glue. Solder 2 cables to the power jack and screw it to the housing. You can then continue directly with the remaining wiring. the LDR can be plugged through one of the upper 5mm ventilation holes. When everything is ready, place the diffuser facing down and place the LED matrix on top of it, which should fit perfectly in the groove and Press the housing onto the LED Grid. Then turn everything on the back and attach the front frame.
