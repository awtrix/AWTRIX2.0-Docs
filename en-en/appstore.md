  The integrated Appstore offers a variety of apps that you can download for free.
  Each app is displayed as a so-called card and provides information about the name, version number, description and creator of the app.
  In the upper right corner you can search for a specific app using full text search.

By clicking on the desired app you can start the download. This should only take a few seconds, because the apps are usually very small (~20kb)
