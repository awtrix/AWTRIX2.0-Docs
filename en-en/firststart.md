# Here we go!

You built the matrix and installed the host? Now we can move on to the more pleasant part.
AWTRIX is mainly controlled by a web interface. By default this can be accessed via the following URL:

```txt
http://[HOST-IP]:7000/
```

AWTRIX welcomes you with a modern and easy to understand interface

On the main page you will find some important information like current app and if your matrix is connected to the host.

On the left hand side you will always find the sidebar which allows you to navigate to all functions of AWTRIX.

You also have the possibility to use the API Tester and get to know the big [API documentation](/en-en/api).

On the Awtrix Terminal you have several options:

- **reset settings**:
    Overwrites your host-settings with the default settings
- **reload apps**:
    Checks and reloads every changes in the App directory
- **update apps**:
    Forces all apps to update themselves
- **restart**:
    Restarts AWTRIX, maybe this will not work on all platforms
- **zip environment**:
    This will compress the whole awtrix installation directory wich you can download as a zip file. This could be very useful if you want to move your installation to another platform, for complete Backup,or for me, if i need a look at special errors to your environment, so i can debug it 1:1.
- **reset controller**:
    This will reset the controller. All Wifi settings will be deleted and you can setup it again.
- **reboot controller**:
    Performs a reboot of the controller

The web interface is also optimized for smartphones and can even be installed as a webapp on your home screen.
To do so, go to the page on your smartphone, open the browser settings and click "Add to homescreen". AWTRIX will look like a real app!

> AWTRIX requires a permanent Internet connection. On the one hand, most apps require data from the internet, and on the other hand there is a connection to the AWTRIX cloud server. AWTRIX receives all apps, app updates and icons from here.
