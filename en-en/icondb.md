  Here you can see all icons that have been uploaded to the AWTRIX Cloud.  
  To use an icon in your notifications or new apps, for example, you need the IconID that can be found under each icon.

To view an icon on your matrix, simply click on it. When you leave the page, AWTRIX returns to normal mode.

  > In the upper right corner you can search for icons by icon name.
