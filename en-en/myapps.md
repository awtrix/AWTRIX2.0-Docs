### Settings

![](../assets/appsettings.jpg)

Most apps have 3 fields that have to be considered:

#### General Settings

These settings are the same for all apps and are not specific to one app.

- **Display Time:**
  This setting overwrites the global display duration of an app.
- **Update Interval:**
  This setting overwrites the global update interval after an app downloads the new data.
- **Custom Color:**
  Sets a custom text color for this App (Hex Color e.g #8034eb)
- **Start Time:**
  This setting determines the time when the app is displayed.
- **End Time:**
  This setting specifies the time after which the app is no longer displayed.

#### App Settings

These settings are app specific. Each field must be filled in so that AWTRIX considers them as fully configured and includes them in the AppLoop.

#### Setup Information

The necessary settings are explained here.
