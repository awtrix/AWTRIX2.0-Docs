!> **With the current controller firmware it is not necessary to change a config file**.  
All settings can now be easily adjusted via hotspot.
This manual describes how to flash a finished .bin file to the ESP8266. Compiling the source code (as previously required) is not described here.

## Flashing

### Flashing with Windows


**1.** Download the Flashing Tool [here](https://blueforcer.de/downloads/ESP8266Flasher.exe)
   
**2.** Download the latest firmware [here](https://blueforcer.de/awtrix/stable/firmware.bin).

**3.** Start the **ESP8266Flasher.exe** and open the firmware in the tab "Config" (click gear wheel to select the firmware)

**4** Go back to the tab "Operation" and set the correct Com-Port if it was not detected automatically.
   
**5** Click on "Flash" and wait until the process is finished and a green check mark appears in the lower left corner.
   
**6.** Restart the controller.

### Flashing under Linux & MacOS

The ESPTool can be used for this purpose
``` BASH
 git clone https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool.git
``` 
If you do not have git, you can download it with the appropriate command:  
[Installing git on different distributions](http://git-scm.com/download/linux)

We also need Python on our system to run this script with the serial package (it should already be installed, but just in case)

In the terminal, we change the current folder to the path of the esptool folder and enter this command to download the firmware:

``` BASH
sudo wget -h https://blueforcer.de/awtrix/stable/firmware.bin
```
The flash process is then started

``` BASH
sudo python esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x00000 firmware.bin
``` 
Note that **/dev/ttyUSB0** may change depending on the UART you use and the Linux distribution you choose.

If after a few seconds similar outputs are read
``` BASH
Connecting....
Erasing flash..... 
Writing at 0x0000000000... (0 %)
``` 
Then everything is fine...
If it does not appear after a few seconds, you may have a problem connecting ESP8266 to the UART.


## Update
You can update the firmware in three ways:  
  
- Flash the latest firmware.bin it with USB and a PC
- Open the IP of the controller in a Browser and upload the firmware.bin
- In Host webinterface go to Matrix status and click "Update Available"
  
  
## First Start
  <div align=center>
  <img width="400" src="..\assets\firmware\wifiSearch.gif"/>
  </div>

For a few seconds the controller will now search for a known WiFi network. 
<br>
<br>

  <div align=center>
  <img width="400" src="..\assets\firmware\hotspot.gif"/>
  </div>

If no Wifi connection is configured yet, the text "Hotspot" will appear on the matrix. As the name says, the controller will now open a WLAN hotspot. With any WLAN device the controller can now be configured via the hotspot.
1. connect to the WLAN with the SSID "**AWTRIX Controller**".
2. the WLAN password is "**awtrixxx**".
3. if a web page does not open automatically, the settings page can be navigated to under the IP "**172.217.28.1** using any browser. This page looks like the following:

<div align=center>
<img width="200" src="..\assets\firmware\hotspotConfig1.jpg"/>
<img width="200" src="..\assets\firmware\hotspotConfig2.jpg"/>
</div>


4. by clicking on "Conigure WiFi" (left picture) you will be taken to the actual settings page (right picture).
   
5. **SSID** and **password** of your WLAN must be entered in the fields provided. 
   
!> **The controller needs a WLAN - otherwise it will not start. This is used as fallback connection method and automatic update via the host**

6. enter the **host IP** This is the IP address of the device on which the host software is running e.g. a Raspberry. Here **no** http:// or port is specified!
   
7. 7001 should remain as **port**. This port is used for data communication and should not be changed. This port has nothing to do with the host web interface under port 7000!  
   
8. if your matrix only shows strange pixels, the arrangement of the LEDs on the matrix is different. You can fix this by adjusting the control with **MatrixType2
<br>
<br>


## Reset the Controller

If other problems occur you can try to reset your Wemos. For example if you need to enter the Host-IP again. This will delete all your saved wifi information and you can set it up again via the hotspot. This doesnt belong to the HOST software.
There are 4 ways to do this:

**Fast and easy**
- switch off your routers wifi
- resatrt the controller
- It will go into the hotspot mode if it doesnt find the wifi
- Turn on your routers wiif again and proceed with the configuration

**Directly via the Wemos reset button**
  
- Reset the ESP
- Wait 3-4s
- Reset the ESP again
- The matrix now shows RESET in red
  
**Via the touch buttons**
  
- Switch off and on the matrix
- While the matrix is showing "BOOT" hold the middle touch button
- Wait until the reset countdown is over
  
**Via the PC**

- Download the [ESP8266 download tool](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools)
- Connect your Wemos to the PC, open the software and click erase
