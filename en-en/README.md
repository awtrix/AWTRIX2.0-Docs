AWTRIX 2.0

![image alt text](assets/awtrix.jpeg)

AWTRIX 2.0 (AWesome maTRIX) is an DIY intelligent clock (similar to Lametric time) with a focus on usability, Smarthome integrity and tons of features. I was able to make AWTRIX 2.0 a great user experience. It starts with the simple setup and installation and ends with the intuitive operation. AWTRIX 2.0 is the result of 3 months of hard work and very good feedback from the community.

AWTRIX 2.0 consists of a ESP8266 as Matrix Driver (AWTRIX Controller) for the 32Ã8 full color RGB matrix, and any Java capable Server like Windows, MacOS, Raspberry Pi, etc. The Server takes over the complete logic while the ESP takes over the commands and displays them stubbornly.

AWTRIX 2.0 is completely free to use. Some premium functions will be available later in a cheap subscription. Until then this can also be used free of charge.
