### In order to make your app available to other users via the AppStore, there are a few things to consider:

- The app is checked and tested by me before release.
- Your app must be fully functional and tested for worst-case scenarios (e.g. wrong settings)
- All texts like setup information, settings keys etc. must be written in English.

### Export your project via the B4J IDE as ZIP:

![](../assets/zip.jpg)

Write an email to review@blueforcer.de and attach your app package.

Subject: **[Review/Update] [Appname] [AppVersion]**

Add API keys, login data etc. to the email to test your app.
All given information will only be seen by me and will not be given to third parties. After app releases all information will be irrevocably deleted.
