AWTRIX 2.0 can run on any platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux), the only requirement is the support of Java 8 (1.8_232). It is a non-GUI application, so no desktop environment is required.  However, it is advisable not to use a desktop distribution to save processor power and memory. So use something like Rasbian lite.

Please note that Java is not very resource efficient.
If you want to use a Raspberry, I recommend at least a Raspberry 3+ or comparable. AWTRIX runs with a ZeroW, but slower.

This tutorial describes the installation on a Linux machine.

## Quickstart
This short example shows how to start the Java application.
Go to the next point for installation on a Linux machine.

The current [AWTRIX Java Application](https://blueforcer.de/awtrix/stable/awtrix.jar) download and run it from the command line or terminal.

**Linux & MacOS:**

```bash
sudo java -jar awtrix.jar
```

**Windows:**

```bash
java -jar awtrix.jar
```

!> **sudo** is not always needed. It depends in which folder you want to start the application. AWTRIX has to create new folders and files, so in a few cases AWTRIX has no write permissions.

## Linux Installer
Enter the following command in your SSH terminal for automatic installation

```bash
wget -N https://blueforcer.de/awtrix/awtrix.sh ; sudo sh awtrix.sh
```

?> Shortly after the start the web interface can be accessed via http://awtrix_ip:7000.

Starting AWTRIX

```bash
sudo service awtrix start
```

Stop AWTRIX

```bash
sudo service awtrix stop
```

AWTRIX Restart

```bash
sudo service awtrix restart
```

## Docker
Recommended: [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/whyet/awtrix2)

## Update
Replace the awtrix.jar or run the setupscript again.
